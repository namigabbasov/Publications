# **Publications Repository**

## **Overview**  
This repository serves as a centralized location for replication files and supplementary materials associated with my research papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Replication files and materials are moved here from the "Research Projects" repository or directly uploaded once a research paper is published.

---

## **Purpose**  
1. **Transparency**:  
   - Ensure research reproducibility by providing access to data, scripts, and other relevant materials.  
2. **Centralized Access**:  
   - Consolidate all publication-related materials in a single repository for easy discovery and use.  
3. **Facilitate Collaboration**:  
   - Enable other researchers to build upon published work by offering replication resources.

## **Repository Structure**  
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a single published article and contains the necessary files to replicate the research. Each folder contains:
- `Data`: Includes all datasets used in the paper, such as survey data, qualitative data, experimental data, or other sources. Each dataset is accompanied by relevant documentation to facilitate reproducibility.
- `Scripts`: Contains code for data preparation, analysis (e.g., regression models, machine learning algorithms)
- `Supplementary Materials`: Additional files such as appendices, methodological notes, or extended results.

## **Used Data**  
This repository includes following types of data across different publications:  
1. **Survey Data**: Nationally representative surveys collected across various countries and years.  
2. **Qualitative Data**: Historical records, interviews, and case study analyses.  
3. **Country-Year Data**: Macro-level datasets aggregated by country and year for regression analysis.  
4. **Experimental Data**: Results from survey and classical experiments.

1. **Regression Models**:  
   - Linear regression
   - Logistic Regression
   - Multinomial Regression with Bayesian statistics 
   - Ordered logistic regression
   - Survival analysis 
   - Other generalized linear models (GLMs)  
2. **Machine Learning Algorithms**:  
   - Supervised models for classification and regression tasks   
   - Machine learning models tailored for survival analysis such as Random Survival Analysis 
3. **Multilevel Modeling**:  
4. **Causal Inference Methods**:  
   - Synthetic control methods 
   - Matching techniques 
   - Inverse Propensity Weighting
   - Entropy Balancing   
5. **Mixed-Methods**:  
   - Combining qualitative and quantitative approaches.
