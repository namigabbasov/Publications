# **Publications Repository**

## **Overview**  
This repository serves as a centralized location for replication files and supplementary materials associated with research papers published in peer-reviewed journals. I move all replication files and other materials to this repository once a research paper from the "Research Projects" repository or just another research paper is published in peer-reviewed journal.

## **Purpose**  
1. **Transparency**:  
   - Ensure research reproducibility by providing access to data, scripts, and other relevant materials.  
2. **Centralized Access**:  
   - Consolidate all publication-related materials in a single repository for easy discovery and use.  
3. **Facilitate Collaboration**:  
   - Enable other researchers to build upon published work by offering replication resources.

## **Repository Structure**  
Each folder directory contain replication files and supplimentary materials for a single published article. The repository is organized as follows:
- **Article 1**  
  - `Data/`: All datasets used in the paper.  
  - `Scripts/`: Code for analysis, modeling, and figure generation.  
  - `Supplementary Materials/`: Additional files (e.g., appendices, documentation).  
- **Article 2/**  
  - Similar structure for other publications.

## **Work in Progress**  
Replication files and materials will be added to this repository as new papers are published.
