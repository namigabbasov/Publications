# **Replication Files for "In Defence of Nation"**

## **Overview**  
This subrepository contains replication files and data for article **"In Defence of the Nation: Why Do Churches Receive Public Trust as High as Their Secular Counterparts?"**, published in *Nations and Nationalism* journal.  

### **Abstract**  
Secularisation theory contends that religiosity and trust in religious organisations tend to decline when trust in their secular counterparts increases. However, in countries where religiosity is low, it is puzzling why religious organisations continue to receive public trust comparable to secular institutions.  This study argues that public trust in religious organisations is tied to their historical role in nation-building and national identity construction. Individuals with a strong sense of national identity are more likely to trust religious organisations. Using qualitative and quantitative data on public trust in the Armenian Apostolic Church (AAC) and the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC), the study demonstrates how the historical role of these institutions in fostering national cohesion and identity during instability cultivates both generational and strategic trust in religious organisations.
