## Files to Run Codes

- **`FPP_small states.Rmd`**  
  Produces all graphs and tables illustrated in the paper, except Figures 5, 8, and 9.

- **For Figure 5**  
  - Use the Stata `.do` file titled `Figure 5`.
  - Requires the dataset `region2013.xlsx`.

- **For Figure 8**  
  - Use the Excel file `Figure 8`.
  - The figure is graphed directly in Excel.

- **For Figure 9**  
  - The pie charts are included in the Excel file `Figure 9.xlsx`.
  - The data for Figure 9 are sourced from the World Bank's World Integrated Trade Solution.  
  - A dotplot version of Figure 9 (as requested by a reviewer) is visualized within the `FPP_small states.Rmd` file, using the dataset `trade_vol.xlsx`.
