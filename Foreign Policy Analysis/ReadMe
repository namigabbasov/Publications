Description of Replication Files



Files to run codes
•	“FPP_small states.Rmd” will produce all graphs and tables illustrated in the paper except Figures 5, Figure 7, and9. 
•	For Figure 5, “region2013” excel data will be used in Stata.  The do.file for Figure 5 is titled as "Figure 5". 
•	For Figure 8, the excel data titled "Figure 8" will be used. Figure 8 is graphed in Excel.
•	Figure 9 is a combination of pie charts. I have uploaded an excel file titled "Figure 9.xlsx" to replicate the figure 9 in the manuscript. All pie charts are given within the "Figure 9.xlsx" file. 
The data for Figure 9 are from World Bank World Integrated Trade Solution. Meanwhile, a reviewer requested to change the pie charts to dotplot in the last email. 
I visualized Figure 9 in a dotplot format within the “FPP_small states.Rmd” file.The dataset for the dotplots is "trade_vol.xlsx."

Except for the last dataset, which is collected from the World Bank website, all datasets are original datasets directly downloaded from the Caucasus Barometer website (https://caucasusbarometer.org/en/).  
I kept all original names of data sets as they are downloaded from the Caucasus Barometer website. 
To ensure data authenticity and transparency, you can also directly download the data sets from the Caucasus Barometer website (https://caucasusbarometer.org/en/) and import them to “FPP_small states.Rmd”.  
In the beginning of the “FPP_small states.Rmd” file, we have given all codes used to clean data.
