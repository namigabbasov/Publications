# Double-Edged Sword: Political Engagement on Social Media and Its Impact on Democracy Support in Authoritarian Regimes

This repository contains the code and analyses for the study **"Double-Edged Sword: Political Engagement on Social Media and Its Impact on Democracy Support in Authoritarian Regimes"** accepted for publication in ***Political Research Quarterly***. The research explores the complex relationship between political engagement on social media and democracy support in authoritarian regimes, utilizing data from the Arab Barometer surveys (waves 1–5 and 7, spanning 2006–2022).

## Project Description

The study examines whether political engagement on social media—such as obtaining political information and expressing political opinions—supports or undermines democracy in authoritarian contexts. The findings reveal a dynamic shift over time:

- **2006–2012**: Political engagement on social media positively correlates with support for democracy.
- **2013–2022**: A negative correlation emerges, reflecting the growing influence of digital authoritarianism.

The analysis identifies two mechanisms behind these shifts:
1. **Self-Censorship**: Fear of repression causes individuals critical of regimes to withhold their views.
2. **Social Learning**: Authoritarian regimes use misinformation, propaganda, and surveillance to shape public opinion and instill authoritarian values.

## Methodology

The research employs a combination of advanced statistical methods to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and democracy support:
- **Pooled Regression**: Examining trends across survey waves.
- **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**: Using Gamma distribution to handle skewed outcomes.
- **Multilevel Modeling**: Accounting for individual- and country-level variations in data.

## Abstract

Using Arab Barometer survey data from 2006 to 2022, this study explores the evolving relationship between political engagement on social media and democracy support in authoritarian regimes. Initially, engagement on social media supported pro-democratic attitudes, but over time, digital authoritarianism reversed this trend. Mechanisms such as self-censorship and social learning—driven by state surveillance and propaganda—explain this shift, with implications for understanding the dual role of digital platforms in authoritarian regimes.
